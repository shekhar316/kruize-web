## Local Monitoring with Kruize

Kruize Local provides services to generate recommendations for both single and bulk experiments.

- **For Bulk Services**: For detailed instructions, refer [this guide](https://github.com/kruize/kruize-demos/tree/main/monitoring/local_monitoring/bulk_demo/README.md).
- **For Demo of Individual Experiments**: Continue with the steps below.
- **For Advanced Local Monitoring Options**: Explore advanced testing details [here](./ReadMe-advancedusers.md)

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have one of the clusters: kind, minikube, or openShift.

### Getting Started with the Demo

To begin exploring local monitoring capabilities, follow these steps:

### Run the Demo

##### Clone the demo repository:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:kruize/kruize-demos.git
```
##### Change directory to the local monitoring demo:
```sh
cd kruize-demos/monitoring/local_monitoring
```
***Note*** : We support `Kind`, `Minikube` and `Openshift` clusters.
By default, it runs on the `Kind` cluster.

##### Execute the demo script on kind as: 
```sh
./local_monitoring_demo.sh
```
##### Execute the demo script in openshift as: 
```sh
./local_monitoring_demo.sh -c openshift
```

```
Usage: ./local_monitoring_demo.sh [-s|-t] [-c cluster-type] [-f]
c = supports minikube, kind and openshift cluster-type
s = start (default), t = terminate
f = create fresh environment setup if cluster-type is minikube or kind
```

### Understanding the Demo

This demo covers the steps to install Kruize, create an experiment, and generate recommendations.
- By default, it creates an experiment for a container which is long running in a cluster and generates recommendations for the same.
- If user creates an environment set-up for minikube/kind, benchmark 'sysbench' is installed and that container is used to create experiment and generate recommendations.

### Using kruize UI

Refer [this](https://www.loom.com/share/d7ace86fddad43918f777835f70b743f?sid=2470c59e-e160-4dff-b664-83a925d6958c) video on how to create experiments and generate recommendations!

### Recommendations for different load Simulations observed on Openshift

TFB (TechEmpower Framework Benchmarks) benchmark is simulated in different load conditions and below are the different recommendations observed from Kruize-Autotune.

#### IDLE 
- Experiment: `monitor_tfb-db_benchmark`
  - Shows an IDLE scenario where CPU recommendations are not generated due to minimal CPU usage (less than a millicore).

#### Over Provision
- Experiment: `monitor_tfb_benchmark_multiple_import`
  - Highlights over-provisioning where CPU recommendations are lower than the current CPU requests. This scenario also demonstrates over-provisioning in memory usage.

#### Under Provision
- Experiment: `monitor_tfb-db_benchmark_multiple_import`
  - Illustrates under-provisioning where CPU recommendations exceed the current CPU requests, suggesting adjustments for improved efficiency.

## Kruize Remote Monitoring Demo

### Goal
The goal of this demo is to demonstrate the workflow of Kruize in Remote monitoring mode and project the recommendations generated by kruize on grafana dashboard. The [demo](./demo.py)  script creates experiments using the [Kruize Remote Monitoring REST APIs](https://github.com/kruize/autotune/tree/mvp_demo/design/MonitoringModeAPI.md) for the specified deployment in a namespace and updates the results containing the resource usage metrics for the deployment. It then fetches and displays the Kruize recommendations for each of the experiments created.

### Steps
This demo does the following:
- Clones the required git repositories
- Installs minikube and prometheus (If the cluster type is minikube)
- Installs kruize and initializes the thanos and grafana containers
- Creates an experiment by posting the input json to Kruize Monitoring REST APIs, updates the results for the experiments and fetches the Kruize recommendations
- Metric results along with the recommendations are backfilled in thanos and launches grafana in the browser
- User can login to grafana and search for pronosana-dashboard to view the cpu and memory recommendations provided by Kruize

Note: The thanos and grafana related steps above will be invoked only on specifying --visualize option, which is yet to be implemented completely.

### Pre-req
To run the test on minikube cluster, it expects minikube to be installed with atleast 8 CPUs and 16384MB Memory.
**WARNING:** The script deletes any existing minikube cluster.

### How do I run it?

```
# Run the Kruize monitoring demo using the below command:
$ ./remote_monitoring_demo.sh

Where values for demo.py are:
usage: ./remote_monitoring_demo.sh [ -c ] : cluster type. Supported types - minikube, openshift. Default is minikube
                            [ -o ] : Kruize docker image, optional
                            [ -u ] : Kruize UI image, optional
                            
# If you want to restart only kruize with the specified docker image
$ ./remote_monitoring_demo.sh -r -o [kruize image]

# To terminate the demo
$ ./remote_monitoring_demo.sh -t
```
