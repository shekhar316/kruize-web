Kruize currently supports three modes: `monitor`, `auto`, and `recreate`.

- The monitor mode collects data and provides recommendations without making any changes.
- The auto and recreate modes are currently identical, both used for autoscaling.
- Once in-place autoscaling becomes available in Kubernetes, the auto mode will update pods dynamically without requiring recreation.
